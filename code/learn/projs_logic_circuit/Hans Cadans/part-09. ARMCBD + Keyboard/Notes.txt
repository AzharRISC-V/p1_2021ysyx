Hi, everone.

I've just finished this part, containing the keyboard.
I'm happy to upload this design, just before my vacation in the U.S.A.

To make it easy to understand, I also have attached some extra files.
The EXCEL-file, contains all the mnemonics you can use at this moment.
The WORD-doc. contains an explanation of all the routines, used for controlling the keyboard.

Next time, I like to make some changes, in order to get a better performance.
Furthermore, I will write some more utility-routines. Of course there is still a lot to do.
The service-routines for the keyboard have to be expanded.

Best regards
Hans Cadans
