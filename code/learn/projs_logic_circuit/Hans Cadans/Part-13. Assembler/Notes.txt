 Part-13. Assembler

Post by Hans Cadans , Tue Jul 12, 2016 7:44 am
Hi, everybody.

The last weeks I've worked hard to make an assembler for my ISA. (It is made in EXCEL)
Well, I've to say, that I'am inspired by mcostalba.

One of my wishes was, to have a tool, that would be able to translate mnemonics and
produce the ROM-file. Furthermore, I want you to understand how stuff works.

So I have made it as transparant as possible. Right of the main-screen you find
all the operations, that are needed to accomplish this task.
If there is anything, you don't understand, feel free to ask.

Of course, all sheets are protected, to prevent you from wrong operations.
It also assures me, that the assembler will work properly.

If you encounter some errors, please let me know.
If you would like to have an unprotected version of this "program", send me a PM.
