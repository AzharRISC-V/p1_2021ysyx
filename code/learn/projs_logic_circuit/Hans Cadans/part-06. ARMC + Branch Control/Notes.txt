 part-06. ARMC + Branch Control

Post by Hans Cadans , Wed Jul 01, 2015 1:22 pm
Hi everybody,
With the implementation of branch control, new possibilities have been added.

I don't know yet, what I'm gonna do next time. Maybe a keyboard or building the BIOS.
In fact you will need both at the same time. The input of the keyboard is totally controlled by BIOS.

Also you need a display, to see what you typing. I have to think about it,

Best Regards
Hans Cadans
