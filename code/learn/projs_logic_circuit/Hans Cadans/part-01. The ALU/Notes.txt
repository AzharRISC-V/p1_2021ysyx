 part-01. The ALU

Post by Hans Cadans , Tue Apr 28, 2015 12:53 pm
Hi Everyone,

In this topic, I will present you the ALU, we're gonna use in the new computer.
It's a 16-bits ALU. Most of the partial circuits are documented.
So you have to be able to understand, how these circuits work.

The description/documentation of these circuits is more intensive than I thought.
So it took me more time to translate everything into English,
I hope, you will understand it all. Excuse me, if, maybe, I have made some mistakes/errors.

When you have questions, remarks, improvements, suggestion and so on, feel free to react.
Next time I will load up, the complete Register-Bank.
This bank consists of 4 dedicated registers and 12 general purpose registers (and 12 spare-/shadow- registers)
