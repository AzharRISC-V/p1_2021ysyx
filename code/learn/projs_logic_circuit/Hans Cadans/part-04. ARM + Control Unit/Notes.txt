Hi everyone,

This is part 4.
In the attached file, you will find a great part of the Control Unit.
This unit almost does all the work for you. Now you don't have to set anymore all the control lines.
All the buttons you have used to control the proper lines, are now in ROM.
The "Opcode" you use now, is the address of a location in ROM.
All the bits (32) of that location control one or another part of the circuit.

I've added a file, in which a program (a kind of) is present.
This program searches for the highest value in a table and places this on location "0" of the Memory Card.

Next time the whole circuit will run automatically.
I hope to place that new file in, about two weeks.
