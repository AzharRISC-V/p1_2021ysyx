 part-02. The ALU + Register Bank

Post by Hans Cadans , Tue May 12, 2015 12:04 pm
Hello,

In this topic I continue with expanding the design with a Register Bank.
This is a set of 16-bits registers. There are always 16 registers available.
The bank also contains 12 spare registers.
The registers R0 - R11 can be replaced by the registers R'0 - R'11.
Registers R12 - R15 always remain the same, because some data must always be available
(for example the Stack Pointer).
In about two weeks I will come up with Data Memory.
This memory is divided in several 4K units. Each unit has it's own, adjustable, range.
