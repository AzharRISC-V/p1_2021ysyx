 part-12. programming. (continued)

Hi, everybody

I'am ashamed, that I've written so little, the last six months.
Fortunately, I can say, that not making the program was the issue, but
actionally the explanation in particular the translation of it.

Most of the time I've spent on the explanation,
and often, when I wrote something, I wasn't quite satisfied (I still ain't)

Now I've finally made up my mind and I present here part-12.
This part shows you, in which way, instructions, memory- and registervalues
are made visible.

Because of the computer is running you cannot put in a new program directly.
Neither you can put in memory- and/or registervalues.
In this part I explain you how these data are made visible.

In a next part (when the keyboard-routines are working properly)
I let you see how you can edit these values, and how you can choose new locations,
which you can edit.

Best regards,
Hans Cadans
