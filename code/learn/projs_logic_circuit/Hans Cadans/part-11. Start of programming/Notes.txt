 part-11. Start of programming

Post by Hans Cadans , Mon Dec 14, 2015 12:38 pm
Hi,

In this part, I make a start, programming the monitor (BIOS)
This monitor will enable you, to write your own programs

You can find all the possible instructions in the CU. (10. Units, 05.01 IR+CU)
At the property page of the ROM, near the micro-counter, you'll see all instructions.

In the Rom, which is called "Monitor", you can find the start of this program.
The attached file also contains a read-me-first file, and an explanation of the first part of the program.

Best Regards
Hans Cadans
