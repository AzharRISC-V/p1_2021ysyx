Hi, everyone.

At the moment, I wrote part-09, I had to conclude, that the design would not fulfill
all desires. Alas, a vacation in the US, during the month September, didn't work along

I thought, that I would need a month time, to change the design, in such a way,
that it would operate better.
Unfortunately, it took more time than I thought. I wouldn't change it, bit by bit.
That is, in my opinion, too ennoying for the reader.
Even though, it is possible, that I've forgotten something.

I mentioned all the changes, and I hope improvements, in Main Circuit of this part.
Also I wrote a little program, that shows you, how to read/write to Program Memory.

From now on, I hope to write the Monitor (BIOS). I don't hope, I've to make changes anymore.
Though you'll never know.
